### Talking about Personal Stuffs:
Apart from being a Software Developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors and playing Professional Chess. In the winter, I love to wear fashionable outfits. During the warmer months here in New Delhi, I enjoy several kinds of beverages, regional foods and explore a lot of people and even I want to travel through different Cultures.

When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the back-end web development world.
