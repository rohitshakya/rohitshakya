### Glad to see you here! ðŸ¤© &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Niteshrocks.Niteshrocks)

I'm currently an MSc student at Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi. I'm passionate about web and software development.
<br />

### Talking about Personal Stuffs:
Apart from being a Software Developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors and playing Professional Chess. In the winter, I love to wear fashionable outfits. During the warmer months here in New Delhi, I enjoy several kinds of beverages, regional foods and explore a lot of people and even I want to travel through different Cultures.

When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the back-end web development world.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Digital Image Processing 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, data structures, algorithm and chess.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: rohit.rkshakya@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Champ
- âš¡ Big fan of Marvel and Harry Potter films
